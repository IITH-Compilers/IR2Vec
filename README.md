# IR2Vec
`IR2Vec` is a LLVM IR based framework to generate distributed representations for the source code in an unsupervised manner, which can be used to represent programs as input to solve machine learning tasks that take programs as inputs.

This repo contains the source code and relevant information described in the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3418463) ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06228)).
Please see [here](https://compilers.cse.iith.ac.in/projects/ir2vec/) for more details.

## Requirements
* cmake (>= 3.13.4)
* GNU Make (4.2.1)
* LLVM (16.0.0) - [src](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/release/16.x), [release](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html#16.0.0)
    * Support for latest LLVM versions would be added soon
* Eigen library (3.3.7)
* Python (3.6.7)
* Other python requirements
    * For training the vocabulary are available in [seed_embeddings/OpenKE/requirements.txt](./seed_embeddings/OpenKE/requirements.txt), and
    * For running experiments are available in [experiments/exp_requirements.yaml](./experiments/exp_requirements.yaml)
    * Conda/Anaconda based virtual environment is assumed

(Experiments are done on an Ubuntu 18.04 machine)

## Binaries and Libraries - Artifacts
Binaries and Libraries (.a and .so) are autogenerated for every relevant checkin using GitHub Actions. Such generated artifacts are tagged along with the successful runs of `Publish` workflow and can be found [here](https://github.com/IITH-Compilers/IR2Vec/actions?query=workflow%3APublish).

## Building from source
1. `mkdir build && cd build`
2. IR2Vec uses Eigen library. If your system already have Eigen (3.3.7) setup, you can skip this step.
    1. Download and extract the released version.
        * `wget https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/archive/3.3.7/eigen-3.3.7.tar.gz`
        * `tar -xvzf eigen-3.3.7.tar.gz`
    2. `mkdir eigen-build && cd eigen-build`
    3. `cmake ../eigen-3.3.7 && make`
    4. `cd ../`
3. `cmake -DLT_LLVM_INSTALL_DIR=<path_to_LLVM_build_dir> -DEigen3_DIR=<path_to_eigen_build_dir> [-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_dir>] ../src`
4. `make [&& make install]`

This process would generate `ir2vec` binary under `build/bin` directory, `libIR2Vec.a` and `libIR2Vec.so` under `build/lib` directory.

To ensure the correctness, run `make verify-all`

## Generating program representations
`IR2Vec` can be used either as a stand alone tool using binary, or can be integrated with any third party tools using libraries. Please see below for the usage
instructions.

### Using Binary
> ir2vec -\<mode\> -vocab \<seedEmbedding-file-path\> -o \<output-file\> -level \<p|f\> -class \<class-number\> -funcName=\<function-name\> \<input-ll-file\>

#### Command-Line options

- `mode` - can be one of `sym`/`fa`
    - `sym` denotes Symbolic representation
    - `fa` denotes Flow-Aware representation
- `vocab`  - the path to the seed embeddings file
-  `o` - file in which the embeddings are to be appended;     (Note : If  file doesn’t exist, new file would be created, else embeddings would be appended)
- `level` - can be one of chars `p`/`f`.
    - `p` denotes `program level` encoding
    - `f` denotes `function level` encoding
- `class` - non-mandatory argument. Used for the purpose of mentioning class labels for *classification tasks* (To be used with the `level p`). Defaults to *-1*.  When, not equal to -1, the pass prints `class-number` followed by the corresponding  embeddings
- `funcName` - also a non-mandatory argument. Used for generating embeddings only for the functions with given name. `level` should be `f` while using this option

Please use `--help` for further details.

**Format of the output embeddings in `output_file`**
- If the `level` is `p`:

>     <class-number> <Embeddings>
*class-number would be printed only if it is not -1*

 - If the `level` is `f`

>     <function-name> = <Embeddings>

#### Flow-Aware Embeddings
* `` ir2vec -fa -vocab vocabulary/seedEmbeddingVocab-llvm17.txt -o <output_file> -level <p|f>  -class <class-number> <input_ll_file>``

#### Symbolic Embeddings
 * `` ir2vec -sym -vocab vocabulary/seedEmbeddingVocab-llvm17.txt -o <output_file> -level <p|f> -class <class-number> <input_ll_file>``

#### On-demand Flow-Aware Embeddings
* `` ir2vec -fa -vocab vocabulary/seedEmbeddingVocab-llvm17.txt -o <output_file> -level f  -class <class-number> -funcName=\<function-name\><input_ll_file>``

#### On-demand Symbolic Embeddings
 * `` ir2vec -sym -vocab vocabulary/seedEmbeddingVocab-llvm17.txt -o <output_file> -level f -class <class-number> -funcName=\<function-name\> <input_ll_file>``

## Using Libraries
The libraries can be installed by passing the installation location to the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` flag during `cmake` followed by `make install`.
The interfaces are available in [`IR2Vec.h`](./src/include/IR2Vec.h). External projects that would like to use `IR2Vec` can access the functionality
using these exposed interfaces on including `IR2Vec.h` from the installed location after linking statically or dynamically.

* If the project does not use LLVM, LLVM dependencies have to be linked and included separately.
* Please ensure that the IR2Vec libraries are compiled with compatible LLVM.
   * If you are getting errors, please recompile IR2Vec by passing the current LLVM install directory path to `LT_LLVM_INSTALL_DIR` during cmake.

The following template can be used to link IR2vec libraries on a cmake based project.

```cmake
set(IR2VEC_INSTALL_DIR "" CACHE PATH "IR2Vec installation directory")
include_directories("${IR2VEC_INSTALL_DIR}/include")
target_link_libraries(<your_executable_or_library> PUBLIC ${IR2VEC_INSTALL_DIR}/lib/<libIR2Vec.a or libIR2Vec.so>)
```

And then pass the location of IR2Vec's install prefix to `DIR2VEC_INSTALL_DIR` during cmake.

The following example snippet shows how to query the exposed vector representations.

```c++
#include "IR2Vec.h"

// Creating object to generate FlowAware representation
auto ir2vec =
      IR2Vec::Embeddings(<LLVM Module>, IR2Vec::IR2VecMode::FlowAware,
                         "./vocabulary/seedEmbeddingVocab-llvm17.txt");

// Getting Instruction vectors corresponding to the instructions in <LLVM Module>
auto instVecMap = ir2vec.getInstVecMap();
// Access the generated vectors
for (auto instVec : instVecMap) {
    outs() << "Instruction : ";
    instVec.first->print(outs());
    outs() << ": ";

    for (auto val : instVec.second)
      outs() << val << "\t";
}

// Getting vectors corresponding to the functions in <LLVM Module>
auto funcVecMap = ir2vec.getFunctionVecMap();
// Access the generated vectors
for (auto funcVec : funcVecMap) {
    outs() << "Function : " << funcVec.first->getName() << "\n";
    for (auto val : funcVec.second)
      outs() << val << "\t";
  }

// Getting the program vector
auto pgmVec = ir2vec.getProgramVector();
// Access the generated vector
for (auto val : pgmVec)
    outs() << val << "\t";
```
